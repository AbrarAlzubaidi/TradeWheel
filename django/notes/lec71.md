# django filters
- filtration means that we need to filter our huge data to a small data so we can search/view the specific data that we need to view it.
- as an example: we want to buy an item in amazon if we search for that item in the home page somehow we will find it after a lot of time (and as they said time is money) so by filtering the data into small data (by price, category, ..etc) it will make our life much easier than without filteration. (just imagin the searching without filteration is ðŸ¤¯)
- to filter the data in function view we need to use another library called [`django-filter`](https://django-filter.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
